                    I am many things, but for the purpose of this portfolio, I'll keep it short... I am a Frontend Developer
                    who specializes in optimized and fun animations primarily through the use of GSAP (Green Sock Animation
                    Platform). <br><br>
                    I also try my best to avoid vibe coding when it comes to creating these sites to make the best out of my 
                    own creativity. What good is a Frontend Developer without a good sense of how to organize things on their
                    own? <br><br>
                    Since this is not only something to put myself out there, but also a passion project I put some time and
                    effort into, the non-important stuff like my hobbies and separate side projects will be off in another 
                    section to keep the site from getting flooded.
